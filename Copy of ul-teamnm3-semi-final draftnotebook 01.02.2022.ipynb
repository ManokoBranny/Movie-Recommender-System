Around the world, movie industries have been blessed with creative geniuses in the form of directors, screenwriters, actors, sound designers and cinematographers. Together with the rise in popularity of portable devices, capable of hosting streaming services, movies have ensured that people can stay glued to their favourites whether in transit or in the corners of their homes. \n","\n","However, the spread into a plethora of genres ranging from romance to comedy to science fiction to horror has created a new problem of information overload, where choice and decision-making for individuals has become quite challenging. \n","\n","In today’s technology driven world, there have been several attempts to solving this problem using recommender systems. These systems are basically a subclass of intelligent information filtering processes that provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user.\n","\n","Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential for industry clients, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity. \n","\n","![IMG_3532.png](attachment:1293c550-39df-42d0-bd59-6aba283d8dc9.png)\n","\n","In this Notebook, the **Infinity AI** team identifies some insights into data that can be used for the development of a few recommender systems.

Basically, collaborative filtering is based on the interaction of all users in the system with the items (movies). Thus, every user impacts the final outcome of this ML-based recommendation system, while content-based filtering depends strictly on the data from one user for its modeling.\n","\n","Collaborative filtering algorithms are divided into two categories:\n","\n","- **User-based collaborative filtering**. The idea is to look for similar patterns in movie preferences in the target user and other users in the database.\n","- **Item-based collaborative filtering**.

This is especially true for modern movie fans, who have thousands of movies to pick from. But thanks to machine learning, we now have recommendation systems based on its complex algorithms and techniques.\n","\n","Today, movie recommendation systems are widely used by the most popular streaming services, enabling a more personalized experience and increased user satisfaction across the platforms. Why do we need them? It’s estimated that the world cinema has released more than 500,000 movies — a number beyond one person’s control. With such an enormous number of motion pictures to choose from, developing and improving recommendation systems with ML was a crucial step to make this process easier and feasible.\n","\n","Once again, ML proves to be a vital technological solution that makes our lives easier. And the more these systems evolve, the more advanced ML techniques we have at our disposal that generate the most accurate content for users and give them what they are looking for.\n","\n","On this notebook we constructed such system.We constructed a recommendation algorithm based on content and collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not watched yet based on their historical preference."],"metadata":{"id":"hZfJgxvSmml6"}}]}
